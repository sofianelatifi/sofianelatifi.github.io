    I am currently in my fourth doctoral year at the Center for Research in Economics and Statistics (<a href="https://crest.science/">CREST</a>). My research investigates the simultaneous contributions of cultural change and shifts in the labour market to the rise in divorce, births outside of marriage, and single motherhood in Western countries. Additionally, I examine the interplay between these cultural and economic factors. Using quantitative methods, I focus on France from the 1970s to the present day. My analysis draws on a diverse array of data sources, including census records, diocesan surveys from the 1950s and 1960s on church attendance, labour force records from BTS-Postes, and immigration data from TeO.
