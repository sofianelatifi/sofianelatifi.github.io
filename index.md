## Welcome to My Academic Website!  

I am a **fourth-year doctoral researcher** at the **Centre for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/user/Sofian-EL-ATIFI/?profiletab=posts))**. My research investigates the **rise in union dissolution** and the emerging **social stratification** of union dissolution risks, examining both **cultural and economic drivers**. 

My primary goal lies in refining and testing the **"interaction effect hypothesis"** formulated by Andrew Cherlin (2014). The underlying rationale of this hypothesis is that the emerging social stratification of union dissolution is observable only once **traditional norms** mandating long-term or lifelong commitment in all intimate partnerships are no longer strictly enforced.

### Ph.D. Dissertation Overview  

My dissertation is structured around three key studies:  

1. **The Two Dimensions of the Retreat from Marriage** – Using a census-based panel dataset at the commuting-zone level spanning 1975–2018, I analyse the contribution of **manufacturing decline** to the rise in divorce and single motherhood, and how **Catholic religiosity** temporarily delayed this trend.

2. **The Moderating Role of Traditions** – Drawing on the *Trajectoires et Origines* surveys on immigration, I assess the moderating role of traditions in the emergence of a negative association between **education** and union dissolution by comparing **children of Muslim-origin immigrants** and the **French majority population** across cohorts from 1948 to 1989.

3. **A Stalled Gender Revolution—Except in the Working Class?** – Using full-population French administrative employer-employee data, I assess the contribution of **minimum wage increases** and **manufacturing decline** to the narrowing of gender pay gaps within the **working class**.
