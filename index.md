## Welcome to My Academic Website!  

I work at the French institute of statistics([Insee](https://www.insee.fr/en/accueil))** as the head of the team working on family studies. Previously, I was a doctoral researcher at Centre for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/user/Sofian-EL-ATIFI/?profiletab=posts))**. 

My doctoral dissertation investigates the causes of the rise in union dissolutions in France and the
growing class inequality in exposure to these events. In a theoretical first chapter, I
incorporate individualization theories into William J. Goode’s model, positing that the
diffusion of separations to lower-education strata requires the breakdown of traditional
values. The second chapter, using survey data on children of immigrants, tests this theory,
showing that among foreign-born endogamous couples—the most exposed to traditional
values—the less educated have remained as unlikely to separate as their higher-educated
counterparts, despite greater hardships. The third chapter, using census data, demonstrates
that Catholic religiosity slowed the rise in divorce in France. The final chapter shows that
increases in female labor force participation, driven by structural employment shifts, raised
the rates of single motherhood and divorce.
