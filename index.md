# Welcome to My Academic Website  

I am a **fourth-year doctoral researcher** at the **Center for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/user/Sofian-EL-ATIFI/?profiletab=posts)**. My research investigates the **rise in union dissolution**, examining both **cultural and economic drivers** behind this major demographic shift.  

## Ph.D. Dissertation Overview  

My dissertation is structured around three key studies:  
1. **The Two Dimensions of the Retreat from Marriage** – I examine how **manufacturing job losses** have contributed to the rise in divorce, and how **mid-20th-century Catholic religiosity** temporarily delayed the rise in divorce and nonmarital births.  
2. **From Tradition to Individualization** – I analyze union dissolution risks **across birth cohorts**, comparing **immigrants and children of immigrants** from **Muslim and Southern European countries** to the majority population.  
3. **A Stalled Gender Revolution—Except in the Working Class?** – I compare the **evolution of gender gaps in the labour market** between social classes.
