## Welcome to My Academic Website!  

I am a **fourth-year doctoral researcher** at the **Centre for Research in Economics and Statistics ([CREST](https://crest.science/user/Sofian-EL-ATIFI/?profiletab=posts))**. My research investigate **economic and cultural** causes of the increasing class inequality in **union dissolution** in Western societies. 

Drawing on William J. Goode’s theory (1962), I posit that this shift results from the interaction of two key variables: **marital strain** and **barriers** to union dissolution. 

**Chapter 1** discusses and extends Goode’s strain-barrier theory by formally incorporating **ideational change**.
**Chapter 2** The second chapter, a direct empirical test of this updated theory, uses survey data on **children of immigrants** from conservative countries.
**Chapter 3** Chapter three assesses whether **religiosity** acted as a barrier to nonmarital births and divorce at the onset of their spread, using census and church attendance data.
**Chapter 4** The last chapter, combining census and administrative employer-employee data, investigates the impact of **manufacturing job losses** on single motherhood and divorce.
