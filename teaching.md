# Teaching

I am passionate about teaching and have contributed to higher education as a lecturer and teaching assistant at **ENSAE** and **Université Paris 1 – Panthéon Sorbonne**. My involvement extends to organising academic events, such as seminars and reading groups at CREST.

My teaching experience covers courses in sociology and quantitative methods.

## Lecturer
- **"Introduction to Social Sciences"** – ENSAE, Autumn 2024  
  Together with my colleague Julia Nicolas, I designed and delivered this introductory course, providing students with a comprehensive foundation in key sociological concepts, theories, and methods.

## Teaching Assistant
- **"Sociology of Social Relations"** with Pascal Barbier – Université Paris 1 – Panthéon Sorbonne, Winter and Spring 2023  
  Supported students in conducting sociological analyses of interviews focused on the musical preferences of young individuals.

- **"Introduction to Statistics and Econometrics"** with Matthieu Lerasle – ENSAE, Winter and Spring 2022  
  Assisted with solving theoretical exercises in probability, statistics, and econometrics (e.g., constructing and characterizing estimators, determining confidence intervals, and developing statistical tests). Conducted practical applications using the R software.

## Mentoring and Supervision
- Supervised a two-month undergraduate internship at ENSAE in Summer 2023, guiding research on the relationship between unemployment and property crime in France. This experience allowed me to mentor a student through all stages of research design, data analysis, and interpretation.
